<h2>A Simple Http server for sending messages.</h2>

This is a simple http server wriiten in python. 
It's a very light weight server that saves the messages and send it to the user when the user logs in.


<h2>Motivation</h2>
I always wanted to write a simple chat server that does not require all the clients to be online at the same time.
I also didn't want it to be dependent on extra libs. I don't know why but i just wanted it to have as few dependencies
as possible.

<h2>Dependencies.</h2>

python 3.x

yep thats it. :) I will try to keep it that way as long as its possible.

<h2>Note.</h2>
<p>This server should not be used in depoyment. Its not secure at all.
I would suggest securing it before you use it.
There are two reasons for this.</p>
<p>1) I wanted it to be as general as possible so anyone forking it can take this 
project in any direction they wany.</p>
<p>2) I want the encrypting to be end-to-end so as to keep the server
as fast and light as possible.</p>
